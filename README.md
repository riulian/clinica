schedule for a clinic that performs medical therapies where we have
implemented the following:
- registration and login of users with different levels of access
-admin interface where therapists, therapies, therapist program, patients with
indicated therapies and period of stay in the clinic are introduced
- the core of the project using alghoritms
because there is only two or three medical devices and number of doctors is
limited and some pacients need imediatly a therapy and the pacients are many
- finding the best schedule option for patients, doctors and medical devices.
The schedule is generated for two weeks but in this time changes may occur:
other patients come, doctors change their schedule, etc. With the push of a
button, the schedule is generated again, taking in consideration the new
situation
